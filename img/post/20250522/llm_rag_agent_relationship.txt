**Detailed Textual Description (if ASCII art is unclear):**

This diagram uses nested boxes to represent a layered relationship.

1.  **Outermost Layer: AGENT**
    *   A large box labeled "AGENT".
    *   Sub-text: "(Planning, Tool Use, Memory, Task Execution)".
    *   This represents the most comprehensive system.

2.  **Middle Layer (within AGENT): RAG**
    *   Inside the AGENT box, there's a slightly smaller, nested box labeled "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)".
    *   Sub-text: "(LLM + External Knowledge Access)".
    *   This shows that RAG is a part of or a capability that can be utilized by the Agent, and it builds upon the LLM.

3.  **Innermost Layer (within RAG and AGENT): LLM**
    *   Inside the RAG box (and thus also within the AGENT box), there's the smallest box labeled "LLM (Large Language Model)".
    *   Sub-text: "(Core Language Understanding & Generation)".
    *   This represents the foundational component.

The nesting clearly shows that LLM is the core, RAG is an enhancement or specific application pattern of LLM by adding external knowledge access, and an Agent is a broader system that uses LLM (often an RAG-enabled LLM) as its central intelligence, augmented by other capabilities like planning, memory, and tool use. The Agent orchestrates these components to achieve goals.

All three textual diagrams have been created and saved to the `img/post/20250522/` directory.
I will now submit the subtask report.
