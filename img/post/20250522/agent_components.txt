**Detailed Textual Description (if ASCII art is unclear):**

This diagram represents the AI Agent components in a somewhat Hub-and-Spoke / Flow manner.

1.  At the top, "Sensors/Perception (Input: Text, etc.)" box, with an arrow pointing downwards.
2.  This arrow leads to the central "LLM (Brain)" box.
3.  The "LLM (Brain)" box has arrows pointing to and from several modules, indicating interaction:
    *   An arrow points from LLM down to "Planning Module". An arrow also points from "Planning Module" back up to LLM.
    *   An arrow points from LLM down to "Memory (ST, LT)" (Short-Term, Long-Term). An arrow also points from "Memory" back up to LLM.
    *   An arrow points from LLM down to "Tool Use Module (Tools)". An arrow also points from "Tool Use Module" back up to LLM. This box has a note: "E.g., RAG, Code Interpreter, Web Search".
4.  An arrow points downwards from the "LLM (Brain)" (or could be seen as an aggregation of outputs from the modules directed by the LLM) to the "Actuators/Action (Output: Text, API)" box at the bottom.

The LLM is central, receiving input, and then interacting with Planning, Memory, and Tools to produce an action.Okay, I have created the RAG workflow and AI Agent Components diagrams.

Now, I'll create the LLM, RAG, and Agent Relationship diagram. I'll opt for a layered textual representation.
